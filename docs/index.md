# CausalBuilder user documentation

The causalBuilder is a web application for building causal statements from customized templates. 

## How to use the web application?
Simply go to: [vtoure.github.io/causalBuilder](https://vtoure.github.io/causalBuilder) and follow the following steps:

### 1. Select all the terms to add in the causal statement
Click on the desired checkboxes: if you would like to annotate the biological type of a source entity, select the "biological type" checkbox under "Source Entity".
*insert image* 

By selecting a checkbox, the VSM box below the list of terms is automatically updated to insert the blocks of information that you will later on annotate.
#### Special case
##### Add a biological state
To add a "biological state", whether it belongs to the source entity or the target entity, check the "biological state" box and then you must select the type of annotation: 
* state with modification information only (mod). 
Modification corresponds to the chemical modification affecting the entity (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation).
* state with modification and residue information (mod+res). 
The residue corresponds to the modified amino acid of the entity (e.g., histidine, serine).
* state with modification and position information (mod+pos)
The position corresponds to the position of the modified amino acid in the entity.
* state with modification, residue and position information (mod+res+pos).
