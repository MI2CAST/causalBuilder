# How to?
Some tricks to effectively annotate different information about a molecular causal interaction using causalBuilder.

#### How to annotate an entity?
1. Select the database based on the type of entity to be annotated. For instance, to annotate a protein, select _Uniprot_.
2. There are several ways to optimize the search for a specific entity in the VSM-box, from the most precise to the less specific search: 
    1. search by the identifier (e.g., P31750)
    2. search by the name (e.g., AKT1)

Trick: for Uniprot, using the _'Entry name'_ provides always only one result! For instance, _AKT1\_mouse_:
